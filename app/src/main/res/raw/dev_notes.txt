-UI navigation switches fragments, not activities.

The UI uses fragments to switch easily without changing activities- thus components of the activity
is being switched, not the activity itself. From my understanding, this would produce less workload.
->Patient activity holds fragment container as its main view. Navigation is handled via sidebar navigation
panel, which is part of the activity. It controls the fragments active on the container.
->Staff activity holds an initially invisible fragment container and mainmenu container. Buttons switch
these two to visible and gone to allow seamless switching. NEED TO BE EVALUATED- GOOD NON?


Database for the app uses SQLite, more familiarity required.
The database is currently located in the android's /assets folder, may have to move later.
Structure of the tables is roughly:
                    Accounts (all accounts for login purposes)
                     ___________________|___________________________________
                    |                                                       |
     Patients (credentials of patients)--------M-1-----------Specialists (credentials of doctors)

Guide for calendar
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/calendar-provider.html

The patient's listview gets data from a local file called eventlist.txt, from an internal storage.
The eventlist.txt structure is: event,time in one line = "event,15:30"
The staff creates events through fragment_staff_patients listview.
    -specialist clicks on a patient, press the add event or add routine button
    -specialist puts in event/routine data, confirms
    -phone sends data packet to patient
    -patient's phone writes the event to the eventlist.txt
{Updates?}
The event list reads from the file whenever the fragment is created

Files are to be shared on personal basis. Guide below. Uses FileProvider.
